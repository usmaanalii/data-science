## data-science

This is a list of resources that I will be using to learn about data science

### Contents

- [Data Science Your Way](https://github.com/jadianes/data-science-your-way)

### Notes

- I have also completed a project as part of my Masters degree in Advanced Computer Science, which relied on the use of **R** packages such as **dplyr** and **sqlite**. It can be found [here](https://github.com/usyyy/dplyr-vs-sqlite)
